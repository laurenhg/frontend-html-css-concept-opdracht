Introduction
It's time to apply your CSS skills in practice by developing the home page of a well-known company. The designers have provided detailed screen designs based on their brand identity. Your task as an aspiring web developer is to turn these designs into a functional version. View the desktop and mobile designs here.

To ease you into various techniques, it's recommended to start with the basic design. For the basic design, you'll need knowledge of CSS Flexbox, positioning using the position property, and semantic HTML elements.

If you have extra time, you can choose to add all the "bells and whistles" from the bonus design. This requires knowledge of pseudo-elements, transitions, using shapes in CSS, and employing z-index to stack elements. Refer to the bonus chapter on EdHub (Chapter 9) for details.

Note: The example includes elements from the bonus task.

Task 1: Setup
1.1 Project Setup
Create your project with essential files (index.html, styles.css, .gitignore, README.md).
Download images from the repository and organize them into an "assets" folder.
Set up a structure in comments in your CSS file (optional but recommended).
Create a repository on GitHub for your project.
Initialize Git, make a commit, and link your repository to the project.
1.2 Styling Setup
Declare a CSS reset in your CSS file.
Link your stylesheet to your index.html.
Use Merriweather for headings and Roboto for normal text, imported from Google Fonts.
Define the provided color palette using HEX codes, either directly or through CSS variables.
Task 2: Header and Introduction
Create HTML elements for the header and introduction.
Style the navigation bar to have menu items neatly aligned on the right.
Center the content in the header.
Style the introduction text and button.
Add a white icon at the bottom of the header.
Implement a gradient in the header using the provided blue and purple colors.
Attention Points:

Navigation links should function as jumplinks, linking to corresponding sections on the home page.
Use CSS to transform text to uppercase instead of writing it in HTML.
Task 3: Projects
Create a project block mimicking the design.
Ensure images scale appropriately by using a wrapper element.
Adjust the order of text and image using CSS.
Consider using :nth-child(even) to alternate the layout for future projects.
Task 4: Services
Create a services block.
Use SVG icons for service tiles.
Apply shadows behind the service tiles.
Utilize flexbox for layout, allowing tiles to grow or shrink based on screen size.
Task 5: Contact Form and Footer
Set up the HTML structure for the contact form.
Create a fluid color gradient for the contact block.
Avoid fixed widths for styling input fields.
Use CSS variables or placeholders to style form elements.
Include a similar gradient in the small black footer.
Bonus Task
Use CSS variables for color codes.
Add diagonal lines between sections using an extended CSS triangle.
Insert floating words like "hello," "work," and "services" behind the content using pseudo-elements.
Use pseudo-elements to add lines under project titles.
Apply a transparent texture to gradients using a pseudo-element.
